## Twilight Struggle
#### *The Cold War, 1945â€”1989*

An attempt to create a faithful clone of the board game Twilight Struggle.

<http://github.com/aasmith/struggle>

### Synopsis

`struggle` aims to be a rules-enforced version of the board game
Twilight Struggle. It has three logical parts:

 1. The representation of the game, encompassing all state needed to
    represent an active game, as well as a rules engine to enforce rules
    and inputs
 2. A CLI or other basic input/output system for playing a game locally
 3. A web API and UI for allowing play over networks

### Current Status

Current development is focused on getting the game engine to a playable state. 

The game now supports all aspects of a player's move: events, influence,
coups and realignments.

Emphasis is currently on getting each event implemented. About 50% complete
so far.

Other areas that needs to implemented include the headline phase.
Grepping the codebase for TODO also helps.

Also see DESIGN.md.

### Requirements

Ruby 2.1 or higher.

### Install

Clone the project from github:

`git clone git://github.com/aasmith/struggle`

No interactive version exists yet, an example of a game exists in
`bin/struggle`.

### Developers

Running tests:

`TESTOPTS=-p RUBYOPT=-w RAKEOPT=-q rake`

Running a test:

`TESTOPTS=-p RUBYOPT=-w RAKEOPT=-q rake N=test_name`

Running the game on autopilot:

`STRUGGLE_DEBUG_ENGINE=1 bin/struggle`

To check event implementation progress:

Number of events left:

`grep TODO lib/struggle/events/card_events.rb | wc -l`

Events remaining:

`grep require lib/struggle/events/card_events.rb | grep -v TODO | wc -l`
