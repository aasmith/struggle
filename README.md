## Twilight Struggle
#### *The Cold War, 1946â€”1989*

An attempt to create a faithful clone of the board game Twilight Struggle.

http://github.com/aasmith/struggle

### Synopsis

```struggle``` aims to be a rules-enforced version of the board game Twilight Struggle. It has three logical parts:

 1. The representation of the game, encompassing all state needed to represent an active game, as well as a rules engine to enforce rules and inputs
 2. A CLI or other basic input/output system for playing a game locally
 3. A web API and UI for allowing play over networks

### Current Status

Current development is focused on getting the game engine to a playable state. 

Also see DESIGN.md.

### Requirements

Ruby 2.1 or higher.

### Install

Clone the project from github:

```git clone git://github.com/aasmith/struggle```

No interactive version exists yet, an example of a game exists in ```bin/struggle```.

### Developers

After checking out the source, run:

```$ rake newb```

This task will install any missing dependencies, run the tests/specs,
and generate the RDoc.
