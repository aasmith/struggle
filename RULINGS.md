## Rulings

This file tracks all rulings that require solutions to edge cases that have
been resolved by using means other than the rule book alone.

Rulings are generally sourced from discussion boards. Each ruling has a
number that can be referenced from the source code, as well as a URL where
the initial discussion and conclusion can be found. A ruling should also be
marked as official if the ruling was resolved by the game author or some other
official authority.

### Ruling #1 - Truman Doctrine: 'Uncontrolled' means uncontrolled by both players (Defacto by majority)

When playing the Truman Doctrine, the reference to an uncontrolled country means
uncontrolled by both players, not just the opponent.

### Ruling #2 - When playing an opponent-event card, the player must always play the card for the event *and* operations (Official)

#### Resolving comment

> "Thanks to Joe L for bringing this thread to my attention.
> 
> The intended way is the standard way the game has been played: that cards with the opponent's associated Event may not be played purely as events. Instead they must be played as operations, with the opponent's event occurring as per 5.2.
> 
> Thus 7.1 should read: "A player may play a card as an Event instead of Operations if that card has an Event associated with his or her own superpower, or with both superpowers. The event then takes effect as directed by the card’s text."

#### Thus resolved as

When a player plays an opponent's card - it must be played with operations also
occurring. The card cannot be played for the purpose of playing the opponent's 
event only.

### Ruling #4 - Clarification concerning influence placement after USSR play of 'Iron Lady'

Per Rule 6.1.1, influence can only be placed with or adjacent to influence markers that the player had in place at the beginning of their own Action Round.

**Example**:

USSR plays a US event card, Iron Lady. They opt for the event to go first. The event places one USSR influence into Argentina. Before this, the USSR had no influence in all of South America.

The USSR player, for the final piece of their Action Round decides the operation will be influence placement. At this point it is illegal per 6.1.1 (*"all markers must be placed with, or adjacent to, friendly markers that were in place at the start of the phasing player’s Action Round"*) for the USSR to place their influence into or around Argentina as these markers were not present at the start of the USSR Action Round.

#### Thus resolved as

> "Rules clarification: you may not trigger The Iron Lady, then play influence adjacent to Argentina if you did not previously have access to those countries.  This is because the influence placement rules restrict you to placing influence in countries adjacent to your existing influence at the beginning of the Action Round."

### Ruling #4 - Clarification of what value Latin American Death Squads affects

Latin American Death Squads reduces the die roll only. Therefore, military ops is not affected.

<http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/226721/latin-american-death-squads>

#### Thus Resolved As

> "All of the phasing player’s Coup Attempts in Central and South America, for the remainder of this turn, receive +1 to their die roll. All of the opponent’s Coup Attempts in Central and South America, for the remainder of this turn, receive -1 to their die roll."

### UNKNOWN: Ruling #4a - Rules for reducing die rolls

Given the scenario of two -1 die roll modifiers being in effect (SALT + Latin American Death Squads):

Is there a lower bound that a die roll can be modified down to?

What is the resolved value of a die roll of one?

one? zero? or negative one (-1)?

### Ruling #5 - Preventing Play of China Card if a Scoring Card Must Be Played

Per Rule 9.5(2), The China Card cannot be played if it would prevent play of a Scoring Card. Given the scenario of a USSR player holding Five Year Plan and a scoring card in their last Action Round (with the intent to discard the scoring card via 5YP event), play of The China Card could be considered illegal.

#### Thus Resolved As:

The China Card can be played in the above scenario, as the spirit of the rules suggests The China Card cannot be used an excuse to hold a scoring card between Action Rounds. This means the rule does not need to be enforced seperately, as existing rule implementations[1] make this point moot.

Source: <http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/952786/quick-q-re-china-card>

[1] Rule implementations being:

 * China Card exists outside of the player's hand.
 * Checking for players holding scoring cards after the end of an Action Round.

### Ruling #6 - Card events that allow the player to play N ops for operations may not use them on Space Race

References:

<http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/940326/spacing-abm-treaty-during-headline-need-a-ruling>

FAQ Section 6.4:

> With the exception of events that advance the player on the Space Race
Track, players must play a card in order to advance on the space race and
may not use ops generated by events to do so.

### Ruling #7 - Checking for a held scoring card should occur before checking Military Ops status

References:

<http://boardgamegeek.com/article/12971360#12971360>

Somewhat controversial, but ruled by creator:

#### Thus Resolved As:

Phase E (Check Military Operations Status) and Phase F (Reveal Held Card)
should swap places in the sequence of play, becoming Phase E
(Reveal Held Card) and Phase F (Check Military Operations Status).

## Pending Rulings

*Items that need a ruling.*

When in an active Bear Trap/Quagmire, the trapped player "may only play
scoring cards". If the player has one card left, which is a scoring card, and
has two action rounds remaining, does the player have to play the scoring card
ASAP, or can the player withhold it until the next AR?

Will assume that the player *must* play the scoring card ASAP, as a player
cannot forgo the playing of a card per Section 5.0.
